# Architecture Decision Log

Use this file for decisions that can redirect architecture, dependencies, scope, or reverse-engineering strategy.

## ADR-0001 — Native C++ reimplementation, not a general emulator
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The goal is to make Beyond Oasis run natively on modern systems while preserving original behavior.

**Decision:** Translate game routines and implement only the Mega Drive hardware semantics required by the game. Do not build a general 68000/Mega Drive emulator as the main architecture.

**Consequences:**
- more reverse-engineering work up front;
- clearer native game code long term;
- hardware compatibility layer must remain narrow;
- address/routine mappings must be preserved for traceability.

## ADR-0002 — User-supplied ROM owns commercial data
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** The repository never contains the original ROM or extracted commercial assets. Runtime/tools read a locally supplied ROM.

**Consequences:**
- Git repository remains source-only;
- CI tests use synthetic/non-copyrighted fixtures;
- local developer tools may export ignored files for inspection.

## ADR-0003 — Fidelity before enhancements
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Reproduce original gameplay and rendering semantics before widescreen, HD, QoL, remaster behavior or Story of Thor 2 work.

## ADR-0004 — 500-line hard file limit
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Source and project documentation files must not exceed 500 lines.

**Reason:** Keep modules understandable for humans and AI agents, discourage monoliths, make review and context retrieval reliable.

## ADR-0005 — USA reference binary, region-independent reconstructed game
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-03

**Context:** The project aims to reconstruct the complete game so the native C++ runtime can target desktop, mobile, and future consoles. Regional retail binaries differ, while existing public reverse-engineering work and known addresses are based on the USA `Beyond Oasis` release.

**Decision:**
- Use the clean USA retail `Beyond Oasis` binary as the canonical engineering reference for addresses, traces, and differential verification.
- The reconstructed game model must be region-independent and must not embed USA ROM addresses in gameplay code.
- Europe and Japan are secondary evidence sources and future data profiles, not separate game implementations.
- ROM-specific offsets belong only in extraction/reverse-engineering metadata.
- Runtime gameplay code consumes normalized game data structures rather than raw ROM addresses.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Europe as primary reference: rejected because current public address knowledge targets USA.
- Supporting all regions equally from the beginning: rejected because it multiplies binary-diff work before core behavior is understood.
- Building a USA-only final runtime: rejected because it conflicts with the portable reconstruction goal.

**Consequences:**
- address annotations default to USA reference addresses;
- later regional support maps region-specific data to the same C++ game model;
- regional differences are documented rather than forked into separate engines;
- reference identity must be established before translating substantial 68000 routines.

**Affected files/milestones:** M2 onward, all reverse-engineering documentation and extraction code.
